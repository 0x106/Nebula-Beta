# Nebula-Beta

Nebula is a testing platform for augmented reality. Simply add the `nebula` script to your Unity project, record a test scene with our application and start testing.

## Install

Simply copy the `nebula.cs` script from this repository and add it as a component of an empty GameObject in your Unity scene.


## Run

To use Nebula in Unity you will need to provide a valid `scene`. These must be recorded using our iOS app,
and can be retrieved from our cloud platform.

Once you have recorded a scene and downloaded the zip file, simply move all the contents of the folder to your `Resources` folder in your unity project.

Run your Unity scene. You should see your GameObjects displayed as if they were part of the original recording. You can move and adjust your GameObjects as you normally would while in Play mode.
